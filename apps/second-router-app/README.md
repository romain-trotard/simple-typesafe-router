# Second small project example

This project is not intended to be launched. But only to see the Typescript inference.

It uses the library `@rainbow/router` which is in the yarn workspace.

It uses Typescript path to resolve `@rainbow/router`.

You can see thanks to this second project that you can have 2 differents router configuration 
that are totally independent.
